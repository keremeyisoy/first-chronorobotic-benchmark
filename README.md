git clone -b txy --single-branch https://github.com/keremeyisoy/first-chronorobotic-benchmark

**what to do**

Please, create a list of weights in every cell for every time window (similarly to /models/WHyTeS/1554105948_model.txt ).
The list of every position is in the file /data/positions.txt and you should assign every weight to correct cell.
The name of every grid for specific time is [time]_model.txt.
Every time window is 40s long, and starts at the time listed in /data/test_times.txt.
It is not necessary to run this tool by your own - but we would like to ask you to send us models for every time.


**parameters of grid:**

edges of cells: x...0.5 [m], y...0.5 [m], angle...pi/4.0 [rad]<br />
number of cells: x...24, y...33, angles...8<br />
center of "first" cell: (-9.5, 0.25, -3.0*pi/4.0)<br />
center of "last" cell: (2.0, 16.25, pi) <br />

**note:**
files in /models/1_cluster_9_periods/ include another values, that are not used by this tool, so do not be frightened.


**software used during developement:**
Ubuntu 18.04,
Python 2.7.15rc1,
Numpy 1.16.3

**installing unusual things**
<br />
$pip install networkx<br />
$apt install libopencv-dev python-opencv<br />
$python run_testing_method.py<br />
<br /><br />

**if you really want to play with it:**

Before run this, please create new directories with your models name inside following directories; 'models' and 'results'
and, change the variable 'model' in run_testing_method.py with the same name of the directories you created.

You can find the list of positions in '/data/positions.txt' (x, y, angle)
Model outputs should be same as this file with an additional column of weights (order of rows is not important for testing method).

Here, are the parameters of grid:

edges of cells: x...0.5 [m], y...0.5 [m], angle...pi/4.0 [rad]<br />
number of cells: x...24, y...33, angles...8<br />
center of "first" cell: (-9.5, 0.25, -3.0*pi/4.0)<br />
center of "last" cell: (2.0, 16.25, pi) <br />

If you change the argument 'create_video' in run_testing_method.py to True, there will be video of every time window in results

outputs will be written in ../results/$model/output.txt in following format;<br />
list of values; [testing_time, number_of_detections_in_testing_data, interactions_of_dummy_model_clockwise, interactions_of_dummy_model_counterclockwise, interactions_of_real_model_clockwise, interactions_of_real_model_counterclockwise, total_weight_in_clockwise, total_weight_in_counterclockwise, total_interactions_of_chosen_trajectory]<br />
<br />
Since this code is prepared in a short time for scientific reasons, sorry in advance for any ambiguity
